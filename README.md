currently, thickness tool is in the making, we have started to make steps to fully completing.

Adding & rotating shape function, we have started this (this will essentially be the vertex tool)

we have also made progress eraser tool. once selected you can hold the mouse and drag over any drawing to remove it.

    points do not movat much on vector tool
    thickness does not constantly increase rather it just increases a little.
